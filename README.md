# ITO-Master: Inference-Time Optimization for Music Mastering Style Transfer

**Abstract**: Music mastering style transfer involves applying the mastering-related audio features of a reference track to another, simulating the professional mastering process that enhances overall sound quality. Control in such a system is important for both professionals and amateurs, as it allows them to achieve the desired mastering results. In this paper, we propose the ITO-Master framework, which introduces Inference Time Optimization (ITO) on reference embeddings $z_{\text{ref}}$ to improve the mastering style transfer process. Our approach achieves effective automatic mastering and gives users flexibility, enabling them to adapt the system to their preferences by adjusting the reference song or specific audio effects traits. We explore both black-box and differentiable methods for mastering style transfer and demonstrate that ITO on $z_{\text{ref}}$ improves performance based on metrics that assess mastering style similarity, including acoustic transformations, dynamic range variability, and similarity with deep encoder embeddings. The proposed framework offers an effective solution for mastering style transfer, improving performance across various mastering styles and allowing users to refine the output to their preferences during inference time.
